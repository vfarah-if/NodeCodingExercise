# What do we want to build?

We are building a shopping cart for an online grocery shop. The idea of this kata is to build the product in an iterative way.

### Technical requirements

- The price per unit is calculated based on the product cost and the percentage of revenue that the company wants for that product.
- The price has to be rounded up; so if a price per unit calculated is 1.7825, then the expected price per unit for that product is 1.79
- The final price of the product is then calculated as the **price per unit with the VAT rounded up**.
- Products are not allowed to have the same name.

### Possible API for the ShoppingCart

You could change this API this is only for example purposes.

**Approach 1 passing objects as arguments could be DTO**

```java
public interface ShoppingCart {
    public void addItem(Product product);
    public void deleteItem(Product product);
    public void applyDiscount(Discount discount)
    public void printShoppingCart();
}
```

**Approach 2 passing primitives as arguments**

```java
public interface ShoppingCart {
    public void addItem(String productName);
    public void deleteItem(String productName);
    public void applyDiscount(Double discount)
    public void printShoppingCart();
}

Approach 3 passing primitives as arguments and returning a DTO
public interface ShoppingCart {
    public void addItem(String productName);
    public void deleteItem(String productName);
    public void applyDiscount(Double discount)
    public ShoppingCartList getShoppingCart();
}
```

### Summary of steps

**Inside-Out (classicist)** vs **Outside-In (London School / mockist)** has significant implications for how the system grows. Since I am aiming for **small, logical, test-driven steps**, I will start inside out.

##### Suggested Inside-Out Iterations (with TDD focus)

| Iteration | Focus                                    | Why Start Here?                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | `Product` - price per unit and VAT logic | Small, atomic, pure ‚Äî perfect TDD start      |
| 2         | `CartItem` - quantity & total price      | Introduces aggregation, still isolated logic |
| 3         | `Discount` - percentage logic            | Stateless, predictable, complements pricing  |
| 4         | `ShoppingCart` - add/remove items        | Start using composition of domain elements   |
| 5         | `ShoppingCart` - apply discount          | Introduces first mutation to cart state      |
| 6         | `ShoppingCart` - total price & print     | Drives end-to-end expectation-based testing  |
| 7         | `ProductCatalogue` or Registry           | Encapsulate product lookup and validation    |

### Evolution Flow Summary

#### Phase 1: Pure Domain Logic

- `Product` ‚Äî validate markup/VAT/rounding rules
- `CartItem` ‚Äî quantity x price logic
- `Discount` ‚Äî test discount % and edge cases (e.g. invalid codes)

#### Phase 2: Composition

- `ShoppingCart` ‚Äî manages cart items and uses the above types
- Discounts applied as decorators or cart state

#### Phase 3: Orchestration + I/O-style Outputs

- Implement `ShoppingCart.getShoppingCart()` as DTO for rendering
- `print()` or `toString()` as test-driving format rendering
- Possibly inject or access product catalogue here

### When to Consider *Outside-In*

You could start Outside-In **only** if:

- You‚Äôre driving everything from the end goal (like rendering the full cart view)
- You're willing to mock deeper domain types (`Product`, `CartItem`, etc.)

But in this kata, that‚Äôs harder to justify because the logic in the "leaf" types is richer and more test-worthy than in the orchestration layer.
