# Introduction

The purpose of this Kata is to practise using the latest patterns to refresh skills and common mistakes I personally may make using patterns I learnt on the job or incorrectly from blogs or developers I may have incorrectly inherited from. The end game is to either be happy with the current skills I have or to adopt a new and better way of doing this
